Going to try setup Lidar reading with UART
No need to poll
Need separate busses
    - although we do have the pins and uart blocks for that
    - Eg use pins D5 and D9
Can raise speed to 921600 baud yeeeeesh


RP2040 fifo is 9 bytes long, so setting up processing code should be fairly straightforward
